Introduction
Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. It contains caffeine that acts as a central nervous system stimulant and when reached to the brain gives high sense of alertness. As an American I drink coffee first thing in the morning. I consider myself as a coffee lover. If I am not brewing in my home, then I usually drink coffee from a café. Everyone has their own preference for the coffee. Not everyone likes same flavor or brand nor they like same café or coffee shop. That is why I like having lots of coffee shops around me so that I can try out and have a favorite one. In the future I would like to open my own coffee shop and therefore I am researching about other shops and its locations leveraging the Foursquare location data to explore the market. For any decision, we need lots of information and facts to support the decision. This project will help us gather information, analyze and conclusion to support the facts to help making decision.
Business problem
To find out coffee shops around the area we need to gather information about the area and competitors. This capstone project purpose is to collect information, analyze and select the best locations where we are interested in to open a coffee shop. For this project, I chose to research in Toronto and New York City and compare these two big cities. I will be using data science methodology, Foursquare API location data  and machine learning technique which I learned from coursera to answer the questions like if a particular region is safe to open a coffee shops or where I would recommend to open it. We know that "New York City" is considered as city that never sleeps so I think New York city should have more coffee shops and more competition comparing to Toronto.
