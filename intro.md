Since I was drinking coffee while thinking about the topic or project problem, I got curious to know which city is coffee lover. I have work on Toronto and Newyork city neighborhood so I will be comparing these two cities' number of retaurant or cafe to find out which city has more shop in hope of getting insight of coffe lovers. I consider myself as a coffee lover so I like having lots of coffee shops around me. We know that "New york city" is considered as city that never sleeps so I think new york city should have more coffee shops.
